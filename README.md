# dBytesStorage
Decentralized Bytes Storage

## Objective:

To create a decentralized platform where users can rent out unused storage space on their
devices and others can use it to store their files securely and affordably.

Motivation:
- Reduce costs associated with centralized cloud storage services.
- Promote resource sharing by utilizing underutilized storage space.
- Provide a decentralized, secure, and censorship-resistant storage option.

## Features
**Core:**
1. Peer-to-Peer Storage Marketplace: Users can rent out their unused storage space
or purchase storage from others on a decentralized network.
2. Smart Contracts for Data Storage and Payments: Manages agreements between
storage providers and consumers, ensuring transparent and fair payments based on
storage used.
3. File Encryption and Fragmentation: Files are encrypted, fragmented, and stored
across multiple nodes for security and redundancy.

**Additional:**
1. Automated Backup & Redundancy: Ensures that files are replicated across
multiple locations, providing fault tolerance and data recovery.
2. Version Control: Tracks and manages different versions of files for easy access and
recovery.

## Detailed Architecture:
1. User Application:
    - Storage Providers: Register available space for rent.
    - Storage Consumers: Upload and manage files.
    - Dashboard: For tracking usage, payments, and performance.
2. Blockchain Layer:
    - Smart Contracts: Automate storage rental agreements, payment, and data
    retrieval.
    - File Distribution Contracts: Manage the splitting and distribution of file
fragments across multiple providers.
3. Storage Network(optional):
    - Distributed Nodes: Store encrypted file fragments across different nodes.
    - File Recovery Mechanism: Ensures users can retrieve data even if some
    nodes fail.
4. Token System:
    - Storage Tokens: Used for payments between storage providers and
    consumers.
    - Incentives(optional): Reward providers for maintaining uptime and
    performance.

## Examples of Centralized Products:
1. Google Drive: A centralized cloud storage service where Google manages all user
data storage and access.
2. Dropbox: Offers centralized cloud storage where files are stored and managed on
Dropbox servers.
3. Amazon S3: Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (S3) allows users to store and
retrieve data, but all operations and data handling are controlled by Amazon.

## Work Flow
**Storage Provider User Flow (Steps)**
1. Sign-Up/Sign-In: Provider registers or logs in with email or wallet.
2. Profile Setup: Provider sets up profile details like available storage and pricing.
3. Storage Listing Creation: Provider creates and publishes storage listings.
4. Waiting for Requests: Provider waits for consumer requests to rent storage.
5. Accepting a Request: Provider reviews and accepts storage contract requests.
6. Storage Monitoring: Provider tracks storage usage, uptime, and payments.
7. Payment and Contract Conclusion: Provider receives payment at contract end or
renewal.

**Storage Consumer User Flow (Steps)**
1. Sign-Up/Sign-In: Consumer registers or logs in with email or wallet.
2. Storage Search: Consumer searches for storage based on size, price, and security.
3. Viewing Provider Profile: Consumer views provider’s profile and storage details.
4. Contract Agreement: Consumer initiates a smart contract for the selected storage.
5. File Upload and Encryption: Consumer uploads files, which are encrypted and
distributed.
6. Monitoring Storage Usage: Consumer tracks storage usage, encryption, and
contract status.
7. Payment and Contract Renewal: Consumer makes payment or renews/terminates
the contract
